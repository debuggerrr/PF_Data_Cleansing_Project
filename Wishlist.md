# PF_Data_Cleansing_Project
**_Wishlist_** is as follows:  

1) If I had more time, I could have tried to analyze the scope of exception handling for this use case.
2) If this survey tool had been under me then would have added some kind of validation checks for the survey forms so that the data received at our end would have been much cleaner.
3) If not, then whoever is the concerned owner of this dataset, I would have requested some kind of clarity like Data Dictionaries to standardize the data while cleaning. It would have helped to avoid discarding bad records.
